Coursera Course - Final Project

I have tried to various approaches to arrive at best result, first by using simple glm method then by ensembeling random forest, rpart, linear regression,
then assembeling all the predictors to arrive at the final model.

Then i also tried using Principal componenet analysis, since there more than 120 rows even after removing the time and names and the like variables.
I used a number of 20, and tried to compute the accuracy.

After analyzing all the models and their complexity to explain, i arrived at the simple randome forest method yeilds the best results in the training set
and as well as the testing set. It had an accuracy of 99%. 

So the out of sample error will 1%.
